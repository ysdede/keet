# Product Guidelines

## Visual & Interaction Style
- **Professional & Minimalist:** The UI should be clean and focused, prioritizing the transcription content and essential controls. Avoid unnecessary visual noise or decorative elements.
- **Data-Focused Efficiency:** Design for clarity and rapid information consumption. Use a neutral, professional color palette that minimizes eye strain during long sessions.

## Privacy & Trust
- **Minimalist Trust:** Privacy is a core feature, but it should be communicated through the application's architecture and behavior rather than heavy-handed labeling. 
- **Privacy by Architecture:** The absence of authentication and minimal network activity (only for model loading) serves as the primary proof of data sovereignty.

## Transcription Experience
- **Seamless Streaming:** The transition from "immature" (streaming tokens) to "mature" (finalized text) should be as visually smooth as possible.
- **Typing Feel:** Aim for a "live typing" experience where text appears incrementally with minimal jitter or jumping, ensuring the user feels the real-time nature of the engine.
